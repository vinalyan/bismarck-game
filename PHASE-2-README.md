## 🎮 Game Rules Reference

### **Hexagonal Map:**
- **Coordinate System:** Axial (q, r)
- **Map Size:** 20x15 hexes
- **Hex Types:** Water, Land, Port, Ice
- **Special Zones:** Convoy routes, search areas

### **Movement:**
- **Speed Classes:** 1-6 knots
- **Fuel Consumption:** Based on speed + ship type
- **Restrictions:** Coastlines, ice fields
- **Modifiers:** Weather, damage

### **Weather:**
- **Types:** Clear, Cloudy, Storm, Fog
- **Visibility:** 0-6 hexes
- **Changes:** Per turn via table
- **Effects:** Movement, search, combat

## 🏆 Ready to Begin!

**Phase 1 is complete and stable. All infrastructure is in place.**  
**Phase 2 development can begin immediately.**

### **Recommended Starting Point:**
1. Create `frontend/src/components/HexMap.tsx`
2. Implement basic hexagonal grid rendering
3. Add coordinate system to backend models
4. Test map display in browser

**Let's build the game! 🚀**
